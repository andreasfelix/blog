## What is great about Rust?
* encourages functional programming
    * minimize mutations
    * minimize side effects
* iterator pattern (zero-cost abstraction)
* statically and strongly typed
* `Results` & `Option` instead of exceptions (errors are treated as values and are part of the type system)
* traits instead of classes
* no null
* enums with data attached (called custom types in elm)
* developer experience (package management, build system, compiler messages, rust-analyzer, clippy)
* everything is an expression (`if-else`)
* pattern matching
* ownership system (no garbage-collection)
* performance
